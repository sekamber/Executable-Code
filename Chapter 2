# Write Terraform Configuration: Inside your project directory, create a new file with a .tf extension. This file will contain your Terraform configuration written in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). Here's an example code snippet for creating an AWS EC2 
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
	}


# Write Ansible Playbook: Inside your project directory, create a YAML file with a .yml extension. This file will contain your Ansible playbook, defining the tasks to be executed. Here's an example playbook to install a package on a server
- name: Install nginx package
  hosts: servers
  tasks:
    - name: Install nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
	       state: present


# Write Pipeline Stages: Define stages in your Jenkins pipeline, such as installing dependencies, pulling code, and applying it to your infrastructure. Here's an example Jenkinsfile.
pipeline {
  agent any
  
  stages {
    stage('Initialize') {
      steps {
        sh 'terraform init'
      }
    }
    
    stage('Plan') {
      steps {
        sh 'terraform plan'
      }
    }
    
    stage('Apply') {
      steps {
        sh 'terraform apply --auto-approve'
      }
    }
  }
}
